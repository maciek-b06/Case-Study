 The Evolution of Gaming Platforms. 
 The evolution of gaming platforms can be dated all the way back to the 1940s, when the first experimental computer-based games were created. This gave rise to an exponentially growing field within not only computing, but the whole world, expanding into a global ecosystem of consoles, PCs and cloud-based streaming services used by millions of people. Over time, each new generation of gaming technology has pushed the boundaries of what computers can do, initiating huge advancements in hardware efficiency and networking infrastructure. These developments have reshaped the entertainment industry as well as broader areas of computing such as graphical user interface design and network infrastructure.
 To take a closer look at this evolution, this case study will focus on two key viewpoints: the societal perspective and the business perspective. The societal viewpoint considers how gaming platforms influence our lives, specifically looking at ethical issues surrounding data privacy and accessibility. This is a vital perspective to study as it examines deeper how humans interact with gaming platforms and how those platforms interact with our data. The business viewpoint examines why cost values fluctuated over the years as well as the role shareholders play in releasing consoles and building value inside companies. This perspective is key to understanding why and how gaming platforms have grown so much over the years, showcasing that the field is a lot deeper than just companies making games. 
# <ins>Business Viewpoint<ins>
# <ins>Definining the Business View<ins>
The Business side of gaming systems is the development of why their cost value went up and down over the years and shareholders in each company that make these consoles release and built over the years and how much value they had inside the company. 
# <ins>The Price of the first consoles to present day<ins>
The price of the first few consoles that sold were around 100-200 euro such as the Atari and the NES (Nintendo Entertainment system) this is now equivalent to 450 euro now.  Now at present days consoles are 400-500 euro due to inflation and exchange rates we can see that they were always an expensive price to some people back in 1986 and that they're still expensive to consumers in 2025 the reason behind the pricing is so the company gains profit due to the build cost of the consoles.
# <ins> The Shareholders in each company<ins>
Nintendo-The largest Shareholder in Nintendo would be the master trust bank of Japan, Ltd they hold an ownership stake of 16.48% with 1,918,842 shares they support the company's management they play more of a support role in the company by approving management proposals at annual general meetings.

 # Two Viewpoints: Societal
 # <ins>Ethical reflections & improvements</ins>
 The Evolution of gaming systems has introduced a lot of ethical concerns. As gaming keeps on growing, the ethical impact extends beyond entertainment and it affects consumer rights heavily. Some of the ethical concerns like data protection and privacy, player wellbeing, and societal behaviour are major ethical concerns in the evolution of gaming.
# <ins> Data privacy</ins>
 One of the biggest concerns is data privacy and surveillance practices. Modern gaming systems like PlayStation, Xbox and PC collect large amounts of behavioural data like gameplay patterns, voice interactions , purchasing habits and even location data. These analytics can improve a user’s experience but companies most of the time fail to communicate how the data is being used and shared with third parties. This can expose players, especially the younger ones to privacy intrusions.
# <ins> Accessibility</ins>
 Accessibility is also a significant ethical concern. In the past, gaming systems excluded people with disabilities due to the hardware customization and inaccessible user interfaces. Only recently gaming companies have started to introduce features and designs such as adaptive controllers, subtitle options and haptic feedback customization. Still, accessibility remains very inconsistent across platforms revealing a gap in ethical responsibility.
# <ins> Summary <ins>
Overall, this case study brought up very interesting points about how the evolution of gaming platforms increased the rate at which innovations in the computing world occur. The two viewpoints (societal and business) gave the topic a different perspective and examined deeper how the evolution of gaming platforms initiated a monumental development in hardware and software improvement (this is just ideas will edit later :D)
