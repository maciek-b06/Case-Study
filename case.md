# <ins>Definining the Business View<ins>
The Business side of gaming systems is the development of why their cost value went up and down over the years and shareholders in each company that make these consoles release and built over the years and how much value they had inside the company. 
# <ins>The Price of the first consoles to present day<ins>
The price of the first few consoles that sold were around 100-200 euro such as the Atari and the NES (Nintendo Entertainment system) this is now equivalent to 450 euro now.  Now at present days consoles are 400-500 euro due to inflation and exchange rates we can see that they were always an expensive price to some people back in 1986 and that they're still expensive to consumers in 2025 the reason behind the pricing is so the company gains profit due to the build cost of the consoles.
# <ins> The Shareholders in each company<ins>

 # Two Viewpoints: Societal
 # <ins>Ethical reflections & improvements</ins>
 The Evolution of gaming systems has introduced a lot of ethical concerns. As gaming keeps on growing, the ethical impact extends beyond entertainment and it affects consumer rights heavily. Some of the ethical concerns like data protection and privacy, player wellbeing, and societal behaviour are major ethical concerns in the evolution of gaming.
# <ins> Data privacy</ins>
 One of the biggest concerns is data privacy and surveillance practices. Modern gaming systems like PlayStation, Xbox and PC collect large amounts of behavioural data like gameplay patterns, voice interactions , purchasing habits and even location data. These analytics can improve a user’s experience but companies most of the time fail to communicate how the data is being used and shared with third parties. This can expose players, especially the younger ones to privacy intrusions.
# <ins> Accessibility</ins>
 Accessibility is also a significant ethical concern. In the past, gaming systems excluded people with disabilities due to the hardware customization and inaccessible user interfaces. Only recently gaming companies have started to introduce features and designs such as adaptive controllers, subtitle options and haptic feedback customization. Still, accessibility remains very inconsistent across platforms revealing a gap in ethical responsibility.
