# <ins>Definining the Business View<ins>
The Business side of gaming systems is the development of why their cost value went up and down over the years and shareholders in each company that make these consoles release and built over the years and how much value they had inside the company. 
# <ins>The Price of the first consoles to present day<ins>
The price of the first few consoles that sold were around 100-200 euro such as the Atari and the NES (Nintendo Entertainment system) this is now equivalent to 450 euro now.  Now at present days consoles are 400-500 euro due to inflation and exchange rates we can see that they were always an expensive price to some people back in 1986 and that they're still expensive to consumers in 2025 the reason behind the pricing is so the company gains profit due to the build cost of the consoles.
