 The Evolution of Gaming Platforms. 
 The evolution of gaming platforms can be dated all the way back to the 1940s, when the first experimental computer games were created. This gave rise to an exponentially growing field in not only computing, but the whole world. Over time, each new generation of gaming technology has pushed what computers can do, begninning huge advancements in hardware efficiency and networking infrastructure. These developments have reshaped the entertainment industry as well as broader areas of computing such as graphical user interface design and network infrastructure.
 To take a closer look at this evolution, this case study will focus on two key viewpoints: the societal perspective and the business perspective. The societal viewpoint considers how gaming platforms influence our lives, specifically looking at ethical issues surrounding data privacy and accessibility. This is a vital perspective to study as it examines deeper how humans interact with gaming platforms and how those platforms interact with our data. The business viewpoint examines why cost values fluctuated over the years as well as the role shareholders play in releasing consoles and building value inside companies. This perspective is key to understanding why and how gaming platforms have grown so much over the years, showcasing that the field is a lot deeper than just companies making games. 

#  <ins> timeline <ins>

**_1962_**- MIT students develop the first recognised game called “Spacewar!” it was created  on minicomputers and mainframes

**_1972-_** Atari release the first consumer grade game. “Pong” kick-starts the whole industry. A simple game with three moving squares to play tennis.

**_1977-_** Atari release the first consumer home console with the Atari 2600. Arcade gaming has already started to plateau. This is a warning sign for the future.

**_1978-_** “Space Invaders” is released to massive excitement. Along with donkey Kong in 1982, this contributed to the arcade in 1982 to generate more income than the music or film industries.

**_1983-_** This year proved to be monumental regarding the gaming industry. This year is known as the video game market crash. In simple terms the industry grew way too fast to maintain (according to the world economic forum). Atari developed two games pinpointed as the final nails in the coffin. They licensed adaptations of “Pac-Man” and “E.T” that were rushed out for the Christmas period. The poor quality and money spent making the game crashed the market. Customer trust was rock bottom. Copies of the “E.T” were found buried by Atari in a New Mexico landfill. It sold so bad they dumped the cartridges.

**_1985-_** Nintendo release their first western console looking to capture the market. The “Nintendo Entertainment System” is an instant success. By the end of production, over 60 million units were sold.  (Encyclopaedia Britannica). This cemented Nintendo as the top company in the industry.

**_1988-_** This year a new competitor enters the fray. This year Sega intends to directly Compete with Nintendos new system, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). Sega release the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis in the US). By 1995 Sega claim more than 50% by 1996.

**_1994-_** Nintendos dominance by this year was well and truly over. Sony come and release their Sony PlayStation. The PlayStation set the standard for 3D graphics. By the end of its life the PlayStation was the first console to sell over 100 million units.

**_2000-_** Sony continued their success with their next console the PlayStation 2. Not only was it success for Sony the system to this day is the most sold console ever with a monumental over 160 million units sold worldwide.

**_2001-_** This year a new player in the industry rears its head. Microsoft decide to enter the console market releasing the original Xbox. Despite not coming near Sony in terms of sales it still sold 24 million units. This shows the strength of the industry. A new player can come in with a good product and sell in the millions.

**_2005-_** This year proves pivotal for the future direction of the industry. The Xbox 360 is released this year with the PS3 coming the year after. Despite being around since the 80’s online gaming is made easier than ever. The Xbox sold over 84 million units while the PS3 sold over 87 million units. In 2020 online gaming was valued at $179.1 billion worldwide.

**_2013-_** with the Xbox 360 and PS3 ending their lifespan new releases came this year. The Xbox one and PS4 were released to mixed reviews. The Xbox one released overpriced and was seen to have restrictive terms for online play. This was seized on by Sony outselling Microsoft winning the so called “console wars”. This is seen as a turning point too. From here the industry can be seen shifting to more online play than physical media

**_Present-_** Online gaming as previously stated worth is in the hundreds of billions. A sector overlooked by a lot of people is the mobile gaming market. With the release of the iPhone in 2007 and its app store a new billion-dollar industry was born. Alone it is worth $126.06 billion in 2025, the gaming industry is not slowing down and with early implementation of AI it will keep growing. The industry is being predicted to double and be worth $333.20 Billion by 2030 according to Yahoo finance.

# <ins>Business Viewpoint<ins>
# <ins>Definining the Business View<ins>
The Business side of gaming systems is the development of why their cost value went up and down over the years and shareholders in each company that make these consoles release and built over the years and how much value they have gained from consumers when buying their consoles giving an insight of revenue and money they gain.
# <ins>The Price of the first consoles to present day<ins>
The price of the first few consoles that sold were around 100-200 euro such as the Atari and the NES (Nintendo Entertainment system) this is now equivalent to 450 euro now.  Now at present days consoles are 400-500 euro due to inflation and exchange rates we can see that they were always an expensive price to some people back in 1986 and that they're still expensive to consumers in 2025 the reason behind the pricing is so the company gains profit due to the build cost of the consoles.
# <ins> The Shareholders in each company<ins>
Nintendo-The largest Shareholder in Nintendo would be the master trust bank of Japan, Ltd they hold an ownership stake of 16.48% with 1,918,842 shares they support the company's management they play more of a support role in the company by approving management proposals at annual general meetings.
The percent margin is 61.4% of intuitional investors holding the Nintendo shares the rest 38.6% is held by the public/retail. 

Xbox/Microsoft- Xbox is owned by Microsoft which means it would be their shareholders in their business that would be the main investors in the business to help Xbox get their funds. Microsoft's market cap being over 3 trillion dollars. The vanguard group was Microsoft's biggest shareholder holding 675.91 million shares in the business which is 9% of the total shares. Vanguard even adopted some of Microsoft ideas for their company such as teams. The second biggest Shareholder in the Microsoft company is Satya Nadella as they served as the Microsoft officer (Ceo) since 2014 he held a lot of leadership roles in the enterprise, He owned 864,327 shares of Microsoft stocks.  

Sony- The largest Shareholder in Sony is the same as Nintendo, which is the Master Trust Bank of Japan, Ltd in Sony they hold a percentage of 18.5% they invest in such things like stocks and bonds they don't participate in business operations like they do in Nintendo with holding management and support. Citibank is the second holding 8.8% of shares in the business they act as a depositary bank for Sony this holds the American side of deposits for overseas corporation making it easier for Sony to handle these funds with Citibank. It shows that when the company started, they didn't have many shares or even people investing just a little startup themselves being entrepreneurs with the ideas of their video game companies and consoles being their start in the video game console business. 
 
 # <ins> Games And Transactions<ins>   
Companies used to just have small purchases for example Mario bros for the NES games for the Xbox and Games for the PlayStation these all used to be bought in stores such as Smyths, GameStop and CEX stores like these that have games in store. Now you can buy games online such as the E-shop on Nintendo, The Microsoft store and The PlayStation store. Aswell as purchase of just videogames came in game purchases such as skins, packs and loot boxes. This shows the evolution of how it was just games that used to be bought by consumers of the company. Nowadays consumers buy online even with games in stores they order them or just use the stores on the consoles as its easier to use for the consumer instead of going into a store and wanting the game. It's also easier as nowadays people use card more for transactions rather than spending money in a shop. With the store too some things went up like games being 20 euro to 40 euro and now their 60-80 euro its due to the companies putting up prices for profit and inflation going up so everything must go up in value. Subscriptions they make as well went up like gamepass on Xbox, PlayStation plus on PlayStation and Nintendo switch online it shows the companies need more profit to make more consoles and earn more revenue for the company to make and build controllers and other console accessories and new and improved features for the system.
 


 # <ins> Second Viewpoint: Societal <ins>
 The development and evolution of gaming platforms have heavily influenced how people communicate online and how they spend their free time. In the early stages, gaming systems were seen as simple sources of entertainment used in a few homes, but as they advanced, the world of gaming evolved into a cultural phenomenon. Online multiplayer systems transformed gaming from mainly a solo hobby into a vast social environment where players have formed communities, collaborate with others, and compete with others from all over the world. This global connection can create new forms of friendship, teamwork, and identity; hence, it is an important aspect and can serve as an escape for many people worldwide.   

  

Modern gaming platforms have made us seriously rethink the things we buy online and our ownership rights to the games and cosmetics we purchase. With the gaming market flooded with in-game purchases, virtual currencies, and online marketplaces, people treat digital items almost like real ones. People buy in-game skins and treat them like buying a new outfit or a new pair of shoes: the only thing is, they forget they don't own them, and the company can shut the game down forever, or suddenly release discontinued or rare skins and crash the market overnight. This new era of digital goods in games has shown where companies' loyalties lie, they will do whatever makes them the most money, whether it's the "right" thing to do. We have seen this time and time again, with these companies getting greedier. With every new game that comes out, it feels like there almost must be some form of gambling that keeps players constantly going back to the shop just to keep up with the competition. In extreme cases, some of these mechanics, especially if a game has an online marketplace where its skins have real-world value, have prompted some countries to investigate whether parts of it resemble gambling, sometimes leading to a ban on the system in that country altogether. 

 

Current day gaming has really blown up from what it once was, when you think of gaming back then it was just a simple pastime, something that was more rare across households, nowadays it is way more normalized, think of the big esports tournaments, those unforgettable characters and just the buzz around livestreaming, gaming is not just a pastime anymore, it's a whole blown entertainment industry. Professional players and massive content creators can pull in huge global audiences and sustain viewership for hours. Slowly, esports are becoming more like actual sports, with sponsorships, massive prize pools, coaching, and sold-out stadiums. All of this has turned gaming into something for people of all ages to enjoy without feeling "different" or weird about it.  

But of course, there's a downside. Online toxicity, cyberbullying, and hate speech still happen. To help fight this, many gaming developers have stepped up, putting rules in place, adding report systems, and rewarding players for good behaviour.   

Finally, the evolution of gaming has led to a change in popular perceptions of tech and learning. Many schools and companies have now started embracing gaming as a concept which have shown several positive effects such as problem-solving, strategy, creativity and teamwork. Educational games, workplace simulations and VR-based training programs indicate how principals of gaming can be applied outside of the space of pure entertainment. From hard sciences to history, game-based learning and simulation are becoming valuable tools for teaching many disciplines.   However, debates continue over screen time, gaming addiction, and the long-term effects of playing violent games, especially amongst young people.  These continuing debates show just how deeply gaming has become embedded into our everyday life and the ways in which society continues to reassess the balance between benefits and potential harm.  
 # <ins>Comparing the business and societal viewpoints<ins>
Comparing these two viewpoints is important as it shows how the gaming industry grew in both financial and societal power. By comparing the business viewpoint with the societal viewpoint, we can see how a decision made by a company affects the behaviour and experience of a player. This comparison also highlights how a change in the behaviour of a player can push a company to change their strategies in return.

From a business perspective, the evolution of gaming platforms seen the rise of advancements being made in technology and cost production. Older consoles such as the Atari or the NES were priced based on the capabilities of the company in manufacturing it. Although, as time went on, hardware became a lot more advanced, causing an increase in the price of each product. This further caused higher expectations from the consumers due to the price point, shifting the focus of the companies on consistent progress and innovation within the market. 

In contrast, the societal viewpoint can be described as seeing this evolution in gaming platforms not in terms of money but in terms of the experience. Gaming has progressed from a household and offline activity into a social network, and as companies made better products such as consoles with online connectivity, players got to experience new online multiplayer features. This comparison highlights how the evolution of gaming platforms not only expanded potential for companies to make more money, but also grew communities and new cultural spaces. 

A real-life example of this is the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). This gaming convention set history for being the biggest and most attended convention in the world at the time. This event was very important to companies like Microsoft and Sony because it was a huge opportunity to advertise and reveal new consoles and games. This caused major spikes in sales and increased the revenue of the companies. 
On the other hand, E3 became more of a social gathering where people got to connect with others through shared interests. Millions of people tuned into livestreams of E3, turning it into a global event which connected players from around the world. Even after losing its fame, E3 fans still talk about the iconic moments which occurred during the events. This example highlights how a single event can be seen through both the business viewpoint and the societal viewpoint. 

 # <ins>Ethical reflections & improvements</ins>
 The Evolution of gaming systems has introduced a lot of ethical concerns. As gaming keeps on growing, the ethical impact extends beyond entertainment and it affects consumer rights heavily. Some of the ethical concerns like data protection and privacy, player wellbeing, and societal behaviour are major ethical concerns in the evolution of gaming.
# <ins> Data privacy</ins>
 One of the biggest concerns is data privacy and surveillance practices. Modern gaming systems like PlayStation, Xbox and PC collect large amounts of behavioural data like gameplay patterns, voice interactions , purchasing habits and even location data. These analytics can improve a user’s experience but companies most of the time fail to communicate how the data is being used and shared with third parties. This can expose players, especially the younger ones to privacy intrusions.
# <ins> Accessibility</ins>
 Accessibility is also a significant ethical concern. In the past, gaming systems excluded people with disabilities due to the hardware customization and inaccessible user interfaces. Only recently gaming companies have started to introduce features and designs such as adaptive controllers, subtitle options and haptic feedback customization. Still, accessibility remains very inconsistent across platforms revealing a gap in ethical responsibility.
 # <ins> Algorithmic bias</ins>
 Another ethical concern would be algorithmic bias in matchmaking and moderation. A lot of modern games now rely on complex algorithms to get players together, Anti-cheat to detect players that are cheating and automatic moderation in game chat. However these matchmaking systems are not always fair. Some matchmaking systems may favour experienced players or players who pay more in game this creates an uneven playing field. Automated tools for moderation can misinterpret slang, words ,accents and result in action that unfairly punishes players. This can raise some questions about fairness and transparency and if players are being treated equally.
 # <ins> Improvements </ins>
 To address these problems and concerns, companies have a lot of options and solutions to implement. First gaming companies should adopt clearer and transparent data handling practices. They must state clearly who it is being shared with. They need clear consent options and privacy dashboards. It would be smart to implement parental controls also. They should encrypt user data and go lighter on the data tracking.
 
 Improving the accessibility would require consistent and  universal standards across the world. Companies should make sure that their new games include remappable controls, subtitle customization and colour blind modes and these are just a few to mention. Y making these features for these companies mandatory instead of it being optional it would improve and guarantee equal access for players with disabilities excluding many users.
 To improve fairness in the matchmaking and algorithmic systems we mentioned, companies need to tell people and increase transparency on how their algorithms work. Matchmaking needs to be based on skill, quality and fair play. Not how much a user is spending on the game. Developers need to regularly test their algorithms and release public results for people to view. Companies are now adding casual and ranked modes which is a major improvement.
 
 for automated moderation, these AI tools need to be reviewed by humans regularly and constantly improved to prevent unfair punishment and mistakes. They should also add appeal systems so they can appeal a decision if they think a mistake has been made or a wrong decision.
# <ins> Conclusion </ins>
We hope by the end of this report that you have a well-informed opinion and grasp on the massive explosion of the gaming market. Despite being a relatively new technology, it is now one of the biggest industries in the world. Being worth $184 billion in 2023. The gaming market was started unknowingly by scientist in a lab playing with their equipment. It is now a juggernaut of entertainment but also is advancing graphical design and networking. The demands of games getting more graphically intense push manufacturers to make more powerful equipment.

The gaming market has had real life impact. With the rise of Ai, NVidia, traditionally marketed for gaming graphic cards is now worth a stunning $5 trillion according to the BBC. This is from the hardware NVidia perfected making gaming graphics card among other products. We can also see the opposite with the video game market crash of 1983. Bad quality products will hurt any market but for the gaming market the lesson was learned the hard way.

In conclusion the gaming market today is endemic and arguably necessary for human prosperity. the industry has done a lot for the world, but the downsides cannot be ignored. The environmental impact is not negligible nor is the isolation it can promote. Despite this the technological advances year on year are very impressive. It influences billions of people every day. There are 3.32 billion people who play a form of gaming. It is going nowhere and will continue to grow into even more of a giant of industry.
