 The Evolution of Gaming Platforms. 
 The evolution of gaming platforms can be dated all the way back to the 1940s, when the first experimental computer-based games were created. This gave rise to an exponentially growing field within not only computing, but the whole world, expanding into a global ecosystem of consoles, PCs and cloud-based streaming services used by millions of people. Over time, each new generation of gaming technology has pushed the boundaries of what computers can do, initiating huge advancements in hardware efficiency and networking infrastructure. These developments have reshaped the entertainment industry as well as broader areas of computing such as graphical user interface design and network infrastructure.
 To take a closer look at this evolution, this case study will focus on two key viewpoints: the societal perspective and the business perspective. The societal viewpoint considers how gaming platforms influence our lives, specifically looking at ethical issues surrounding data privacy and accessibility. This is a vital perspective to study as it examines deeper how humans interact with gaming platforms and how those platforms interact with our data. The business viewpoint examines why cost values fluctuated over the years as well as the role shareholders play in releasing consoles and building value inside companies. This perspective is key to understanding why and how gaming platforms have grown so much over the years, showcasing that the field is a lot deeper than just companies making games. 
# <ins>Business Viewpoint<ins>
# <ins>Definining the Business View<ins>
The Business side of gaming systems is the development of why their cost value went up and down over the years and shareholders in each company that make these consoles release and built over the years and how much value they had inside the company. 
# <ins>The Price of the first consoles to present day<ins>
The price of the first few consoles that sold were around 100-200 euro such as the Atari and the NES (Nintendo Entertainment system) this is now equivalent to 450 euro now.  Now at present days consoles are 400-500 euro due to inflation and exchange rates we can see that they were always an expensive price to some people back in 1986 and that they're still expensive to consumers in 2025 the reason behind the pricing is so the company gains profit due to the build cost of the consoles.
# <ins> The Shareholders in each company<ins>
Nintendo-The largest Shareholder in Nintendo would be the master trust bank of Japan, Ltd they hold an ownership stake of 16.48% with 1,918,842 shares they support the company's management they play more of a support role in the company by approving management proposals at annual general meetings.
The percent margin is 61.4% of intuitional investors holding the Nintendo shares the rest 38.6% is held by the public/retail. 

Xbox/Microsoft- Xbox is owned by Microsoft which means it would be their shareholders in their business that would be the main investors in the business to help Xbox get their funds. Microsoft's market cap being over 3 trillion dollars. The vanguard group was Microsoft's biggest shareholder holding 675.91 million shares in the business which is 9% of the total shares. Vanguard even adopted some of Microsoft ideas for their company such as teams. The second biggest Shareholder in the Microsoft company is Satya Nadella as they served as the Microsoft officer (Ceo) since 2014 he held a lot of leadership roles in the enterprise, He owned 864,327 shares of Microsoft stocks.  

Sony- The largest Shareholder in Sony is the same as Nintendo, which is the Master Trust Bank of Japan, Ltd in Sony they hold a percentage of 18.5% they invest in such things like stocks and bonds they don't participate in business operations like they do in Nintendo with holding management and support. Citibank is the second holding 8.8% of shares in the business they act as a depositary bank for Sony this holds the American side of deposits for overseas corporation making it easier for Sony to handle these funds with Citibank. It shows that when the company started, they didn't have many shares or even people investing just a little startup themselves being entrepreneurs with the ideas of their video game companies and consoles being their start in the video game console business. 
 
 # <ins> Games And Transactions<ins>   
Companies used to just have small purchases for example Mario bros for the NES games for the Xbox and Games for the PlayStation these all used to be bought in stores such as Smyths, GameStop and CEX stores like these that have games in store. Now you can buy games online such as the E-shop on Nintendo, The Microsoft store and The PlayStation store. Aswell as purchase of just videogames came in game purchases such as skins, packs and loot boxes. This shows the evolution of how it was just games that used to be bought by consumers of the company. Nowadays consumers buy online even with games in stores they order them or just use the stores on the consoles as its easier to use for the consumer instead of going into a store and wanting the game. It's also easier as nowadays people use card more for transactions rather than spending money in a shop. With the store too some things went up like games being 20 euro to 40 euro and now their 60-80 euro its due to the companies putting up prices for profit and inflation going up so everything must go up in value. Subscriptions they make as well went up like gamepass on Xbox, PlayStation plus on PlayStation and Nintendo switch online it shows the companies need more profit to make more consoles and earn more revenue for the company to make and build controllers and other console accessories and new and improved features for the system.
 


 # Two Viewpoints: Societal
 The development and evolution of gaming platforms havbe heavily influenced the way people communicate, interact with other and spend their free time. In the early stages, gaming systems were viewed as a simple source of entertainment that was utilized within homes, but with technology rapidly advancing, the world of gaming evolved into a cultural phenomenon. The online multiplayer systems, transformed gaming from mostly a solo hobby to a huge social  envoirment where players have made communities, collaborate with others, and compete in multiple ways with others from all over the world. This global connection can create new forms of friendships, teamwork and identity; hence, it is an important aspect and can be a form of escape for many people worldwide.
 # <ins>Ethical reflections & improvements</ins>
 The Evolution of gaming systems has introduced a lot of ethical concerns. As gaming keeps on growing, the ethical impact extends beyond entertainment and it affects consumer rights heavily. Some of the ethical concerns like data protection and privacy, player wellbeing, and societal behaviour are major ethical concerns in the evolution of gaming.
# <ins> Data privacy</ins>
 One of the biggest concerns is data privacy and surveillance practices. Modern gaming systems like PlayStation, Xbox and PC collect large amounts of behavioural data like gameplay patterns, voice interactions , purchasing habits and even location data. These analytics can improve a user’s experience but companies most of the time fail to communicate how the data is being used and shared with third parties. This can expose players, especially the younger ones to privacy intrusions.
# <ins> Accessibility</ins>
 Accessibility is also a significant ethical concern. In the past, gaming systems excluded people with disabilities due to the hardware customization and inaccessible user interfaces. Only recently gaming companies have started to introduce features and designs such as adaptive controllers, subtitle options and haptic feedback customization. Still, accessibility remains very inconsistent across platforms revealing a gap in ethical responsibility.
 # <ins> Algorithmic bias</ins>
 Another ethical concern would be algorithmic bias in matchmaking and moderation. A lot of modern games now rely on complex algorithms to get players together, Anti-cheat to detect players that are cheating and automatic moderation in game chat. However these matchmaking systems are not always fair. Some matchmaking systems may favour experienced players or players who pay more in game this creates an uneven playing field. Automated tools for moderation can misinterpret slang, words ,accents and result in action that unfairly punishes players. This can raise some questions about fairness and transparency and if players are being treated equally.
 # <ins> Improvements </ins>
 To address these problems and concerns, companies have a lot of options and solutions to implement. First gaming companies should adopt clearer and transparent data handling practices. They must state clearly who it is being shared with. They need clear consent options and privacy dashboards. It would be smart to implement parental controls also. They should encrypt user data and go lighter on the data tracking.
 
 Improving the accessibility would require consistent and  universal standards across the world. Companies should make sure that their new games include remappable controls, subtitle customization and colour blind modes and these are just a few to mention. Y making these features for these companies mandatory instead of it being optional it would improve and guarantee equal access for players with disabilities excluding many users.
 To improve fairness in the matchmaking and algorithmic systems we mentioned, companies need to tell people and increase transparency on how their algorithms work. Matchmaking needs to be based on skill, quality and fair play. Not how much a user is spending on the game. Developers need to regularly test their algorithms and release public results for people to view. Companies are now adding casual and ranked modes which is a major improvement.
 
 for automated moderation, these AI tools need to be reviewed by humans regularly and constantly improved to prevent unfair punishment and mistakes. They should also add appeal systems so they can appeal a decision if they think a mistake has been made or a wrong decision.
# <ins> Summary <ins>
Overall, this case study brought up very interesting points about how the evolution of gaming platforms increased the rate at which innovations in the computing world occur. The two viewpoints (societal and business) gave the topic a different perspective and examined deeper how the evolution of gaming platforms initiated a monumental development in hardware and software improvement (this is just ideas will edit later :D)
